### Title: ML premium

### Description
Using the USA portion of a recent survey of data science professionals, we attempt to ascertain if there is a salary premium associated with machine learning expretise.  While would prefer to use a dataset that includes programmers in other areas beyond data science, this dataset is good enough to try the following tools: **tensorflow, pandas, and matplotlib**

### Lanaguages and tools
Python is used throughout the Jupyter Notebook in a Google Colaboratory.  The Pandas and Matplotlib are also used throughout.

### Takeaway: There seems to be a slight salary premium commanded by machine learning expertise
We are defining expertise as less than 1 year to over 10 years of experience.  While the data point in the direction of a ML premium, the limitations of the dataset make it hard to have more confidence in the findings.  In particular, there are many instances where the same quantity of programming experience and ML learning experience correspond to widely different salaries.  This might be due to a number of factors not present in the survey like regional salary differences.  For example, salaries in San Fancisco being higher than salaries in, say, Dallas.
