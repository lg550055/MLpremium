### Title: ML premium

### Description
Using the USA portion of a recent (2020) survey of data science professionals, we attempt to ascertain if there is a salary premium associated with machine learning expretise.  While would prefer to use a dataset that includes programmers in other areas beyond data science, this dataset is good enough to try the following tools: **tensorflow, pandas, and matplotlib**

### Takeaway: There seems to be a slight salary premium commanded by machine learning expertise
By expertise, we mean anywhere from less than 1 year of experience to over 10 years.  However, the limitations of the dataset make it hard to have more confidence in the findings.
